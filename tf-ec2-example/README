This project uses terraform to launch ec2 instances ia a vpc.

Input Variables -

name - name of the instance default is set to "vrush-tf-ec2" .
instance_type - default set to t2-micro
vpc_id - default set to vpc-0a7c2b7b0f0c6e4c0 (vrushali-vpc)
count - default set to 2 - the number of instances to be launched
key_name - SSH key to be used .Default is ec2-key .Public key in the path "~/.ssh/ec2-key.pub"  
\***\* If a different key name is used please ensure to generate the appropriate ssh key using the command
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f ~/.ssh/key_name **\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

public_instance - default set to true to launch the instance in the public subnet. Change to false toggle instance to private subnet.

The data.tf file contains the information of the vpc and subnets that are to be selected to launch the EC2 instances.
Remember to change the vpcid and subnet information if you want to launch the ec2 instances in different vpc.


If instances are launched in the private subnet then remember to create a NAT gateway in the public subnet and update the route table of the private subnet to route internet traffic through the NAT gateway.
If instances in the private subnet are need to accessed over the internet then add a load balancer.
